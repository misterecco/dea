In modern-era Internet most webpages operate for profit. Most of them, however, choose to provide free content
in exchange for displaying paid ads. Unfortunately, not all websites play fair. Some of them
concentrate on displaying as many ads as possible and generate traffic by using click-baits 
and other shady practices. Even websites with valuable content can have overwhelming amount 
of ads. This leads to grave dissatisfaction of some portion of users. To make their browsing experience better,
they turn to use of ad-blocking extensions.

The amount of users doing that cannot be ignored. In 2019 there was over 615 million devices worldwide
with adblocker installed \cite{pagefair:adblock-report}. This, in turn, leads to loss of revenue for many businesses.
To combat this, some of them choose to deploy anti-adblockers, which generate warnings 
or even block content entirely for users with adblockers.
