    abstract = {A security analyst often needs to understand two
              runs of the same program that exhibit a difference
              in program state or output. This is important, for
              example, for vulnerability analysis, as well as
              for analyzing a malware program that features
              different behaviors when run in different
              environments. In this paper we propose a
              differential slicing approach that automates the
              analysis of such execution differences.
              Differential slicing outputs a causal difference
              graph that captures the input differences that
              triggered the observed difference and the causal
              path of differences that led from those input
              differences to the observed difference. The
              analyst uses the graph to quickly understand the
              observed difference. We implement differential
              slicing and evaluate it on the analysis of 11
              real-world vulnerabilities and 2 malware samples
              with environment-dependent behaviors. We also
              evaluate it in an informal user study with two
              vulnerability analysts. Our results show that
              differential slicing successfully identifies the
              input differences that caused the observed
              difference and that the causal difference graph
              significantly reduces the amount of time and
              effort required for an analyst to understand the
              observed difference.},
